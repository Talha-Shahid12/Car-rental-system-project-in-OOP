# Car Rental System Project

The Car Rental System Project is an object-oriented programming (OOP) project that aims to create a software application for managing car rental services. This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of object-oriented design, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system allows customers to rent cars for specific periods, manage bookings, and provides an admin interface for adding and managing cars.

## Introduction

The Car Rental System Project is developed using object-oriented programming concepts to create a user-friendly and efficient car rental service. The project consists of various classes representing different entities in the system, such as `Car`, `Customer`, and `Booking`. These classes interact to provide functionalities like car availability, booking management, and customer interaction.

## Features

- **Car Management**: The system allows administrators to add, remove, and update car details. Each car has attributes such as brand, model, year, and rental cost per day.

- **Customer Interaction**: Customers can browse available cars, view their details, and make bookings. They can specify the rental duration and other preferences.

- **Booking Management**: The system handles customer bookings, ensuring that the selected car is available for the specified duration. It calculates the total cost based on the rental duration and car's daily rental cost.

- **Admin Privileges**: Administrators have special privileges to manage cars and view booking information. They can see which cars are currently rented and when they are due for return.

## Class Structure

The project is structured using various classes that interact to provide the desired functionality. The main classes include:

- `Car`: Represents a car with attributes like brand, model, year, and rental cost.

- `Customer`: Represents a customer with details like name, contact information, and booking history.

- `Booking`: Represents a booking made by a customer. It contains information about the customer, the rented car, rental duration, and total cost.

- `CarRentalSystem`: Acts as the main control unit that manages cars, customers, and bookings. It provides methods to add cars, make bookings, and manage system data.

- `Admin`: Represents an administrator with privileges to manage cars and view booking information.
